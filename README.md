# my shitty attempt at creating an ASCII art generator :-PPP

### TODO

* refactoring (priority)
  + seperate function for each type of conversion 
  + prompts
* Coloring the letters if text is moved
* Trying to show the art in neofetch
* Making the function to auto-generate ASCII letters in different styles
* Making a website out of this
* Text to ascii
* Dockerise it?

### DONE
* Image scaling for both x and y coords
  + numpy?
* Moving the text into image (finding the right size etc) if image scaling will be implemented
  + done and works as expected (finds the right size of text)
* GIFS
