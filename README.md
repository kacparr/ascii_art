# my shitty attempt at creating an ASCII art generator :--PPP

### TODO

* Image scaling, right now 1 letter = 1 pixel, the goal is to change it to e.g 4 pixels
  + halfway done, made 4 pixel iteration, need to deal with errors etc im too tired rn
* Moving the text into image (finding the right size etc) if image scaling will be implemented
* Coloring the letters if text is moved
* Trying to show the art in neofetch
* Making the function to auto-generate ASCII letters in different styles
* Making a website out of this
* Dockerise it?
